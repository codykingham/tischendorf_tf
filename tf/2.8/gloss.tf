Porcius
Festus
to will

therefore
Festus
to answer
to keep
the

himself
but
to be about to
in
quickness
to go out
the
therefore
in
you
to say
possible
to come
if
someone

day
no

the
Jewish
and not

but
to will
the
Jewish
grace
to grant a favor
to answer
the

say
to will
to
Jerusalem
to go up
there
about
this
to decide
on
I
say
but
the

to stand
on
the
judicial court
Caesar
to be
where
I
it is a must
to decide
Jewish
no one
to do wrong
as
and
you
good
to know

therefore
to do wrong
and
worthy
death
gentleness
someone
no

this
to accuse
I
no one
I
to be able

to give grace
Caesar
to call
then
the
Festus
to talk with
with
the
plan
to answer
Caesar
to call
on
Caesar
to come

but
to pass
someone
Agrippa
the
king
and
Bernice
to come to
to
Caesarea
to give greetings
the
Festus
as
but
many
day
to stay
there
the
Festus
the
king
to set before
the
against
the
Paul
say
man
someone
to be
to leave
by

prisoner
about
who
to be
I
to

human being
before
either...or
the
to accuse

man
about
who
to stand
the

I
to think
bad
question for discussion
but
someone
about
the
one's own
religion
to have
to
he
and
about
someone
Jesus
to have died
who
to claim
the

to be alive
to be puzzled
but
I
the
about
this
argument
say
if
to wish

all
the
to be present with

to see
this
about
who
to say farewell
the
large number
the
Jewish
to intercede
I
in

Jerusalem
and
from here
to call

it is a must
he
to be alive
no longer
I

gentleness
he
but

therefore
Titius
still
